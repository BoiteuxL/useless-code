# Useless Package

Useless Package is a Javascript/Typescript library containing only useless and bad functions. Nothing useful over here!

## Installation

You can install this wonderful library with this command:

```bash
npm -i useless-package
```

## Usage

Import the package in your project:
```ts
import * as useless from 'useless-package'
```
Then, use any function in order to do nothing!

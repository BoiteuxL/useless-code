# Useless Package

Useless Package is a Javascript/Typescript library containing only useless and bad functions. Nothing useful over here!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

Import the package in your project:
```ts
import * as useless from 'useless-package'
```
Then, use any function in order to do nothing!

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! The more bad code there is, the better!
